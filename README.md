# SNAKE
#### created by: Matheus de Moncada Assis

* Done in processing.py using two classes and a main code;
* It took me less than a week;
* The code does not have a documentation at the moment, but it will be developed.

If you want to run this code, first you got to open processing in python version. After this, you need to open the main code, and open new tabs with both classes. Now, you need to press the play button and have fun!
